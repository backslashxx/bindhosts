# one per line
# comment out to enable other sources
# source type should be
#
# 127.0.0.1 host.to.block
# or
# 0.0.0.0 host.to.block
#
# alternatively you can also add links to custom rulesets here
# mainly used to circumvent dns based filering by upstream (ISP, telecom, network provider)
# they wont be filtered out
